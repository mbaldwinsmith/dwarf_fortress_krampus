# TASKS

## Core milestones
- [ ] Confirm Krampus creature raw covers seasonal presence, interaction hooks, and body part needs.
- [ ] Polish interaction raws for birch lash, dread aura, and judgement with tuned ranges and wait periods.
- [ ] Finalize syndrome effects to emphasize pain, fear, shame, and brief stuns without high lethality.
- [ ] Implement themed items (birch twigs and sack) with clear usage notes or optional toggles.
- [ ] Add concise comments and separators in raws to keep readability high.
- [ ] Validate all IDs and cross references across creature, interaction, and item files.
- [ ] Update README with feature summary, installation steps, and any known issues.
- [ ] Record changes in CHANGELOG with dates and short bullets.

## Testing and review
- [ ] Perform static checks for missing tokens, invalid references, and intended target scopes.
- [ ] Sanity review durations, probabilities, and ranges to keep balance playful.

## Stretch goals
- [ ] Add optional extras such as festive loot, flavourful workshops, or reindeer thralls as separate files.
- [ ] Provide tuning notes for fortress mode versus adventure mode expectations.
- [ ] Include guidance for integrating with other holiday themed mods while avoiding ID conflicts.
