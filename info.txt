[NAME:Krampus of Midwinter (Megabeast)]
[DESCRIPTION:At the edge of the year, when the nights grow long and the world turns inward, Krampus walks.

This mod introduces Krampus as a midwinter megabeast drawn from Alpine folklore and Dwarf Fortress tradition. He does not come as a simple killer, but as a punisher and disturber. His presence unsettles the fortress. Bells echo, courage falters, and even the stout-hearted feel a creeping unease.

Krampus lashes the unwary with birch-switch justice, leaves survivors shaken by shame and fear, and sometimes fixes his gaze upon a single soul for judgement. He carries a heavy sack and leaves behind unsettling traces of his passing.

This is a raw-only mod with no scripting required. Generate a new world, prepare your fortress, and remember that not every winter visitor comes bearing gifts.]
