[NAME:Krampus of Midwinter (Festive Megabeast)]
[DESCRIPTION:At the edge of the year, when the nights grow long and the world turns inward, Krampus walks.

This mod introduces Krampus as a midwinter megabeast drawn from Alpine folklore and Dwarf Fortress tradition. He does not come as a simple killer, but as a punisher and disturber. His presence unsettles the fortress. Bells echo, courage falters, and even the stout-hearted feel a creeping unease.

Krampus lashes the unwary with birch-switch justice, leaves survivors shaken by shame and fear, and sometimes fixes his gaze upon a single soul for judgement.

This is a raw-only mod. If DFHack is installed, it auto-announces Krampus arrivals and deaths, and spawns the birch switch on death. Generate a new world, prepare your fortress, and remember that not every winter visitor comes bearing gifts.

Please do offer balance suggestions!]
